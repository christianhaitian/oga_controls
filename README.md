# How to build
## Prereqs
libevdev-dev

### Build
```
git clone https://github.com/JuanMiguelBG/oga_controls.git -b universal
cd oga_controls
make all
```

If you want some debug info, add CXFLAGS="-DDEBUG" to the make command line.

If you want some test info, add CXFLAGS="-DTESTING_LAG" to the make command line.

If you want to debug the code, add CXFLAGS="-g" to the make command line.

You can merge that flags too, example: CXFLAGS="-DTESTING_LAG -DDEBUG -g"


# Howto
Launch with `sudo ./oga_controls your-program your-rk3326-device`.  Ex. `sudo ./oga_controls bgdi oga`

Allowed rk3326-device values = anbernic, chi, oga, ogs, rk2020

The **your-program** field is to provide support for force quitting a running app using assigned hotkeys.  For instance, using the minus key + start will force quit **your-program** on the rgb10.

# /etc/udev/rules.d
```
SUBSYSTEM=="misc", KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0660", GROUP="uinput"
```
